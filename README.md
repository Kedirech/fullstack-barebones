# fullstack-barebones
Terribly minimal fullstack app demonstrating Angular http requests interacting with two server endpoints and one Mongo collection, for DevMountain coding bootcamp students.

- fork and clone this repository
- run `npm install` to automatically install all dependencies listed in package.json
- ensure that `mongod` is running
- serve the server.js file using `nodemon` or other
- in your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) to test functionality

Besides package.json, there are only **TWO** files here. I figured not having to jump back and forth between tons of files might help with putting the pieces together.

Now, keep in mind there are no routes, directives, cross-collection references, or modular controllers. That being said, if you can understand every line of these two files, you should be _VERY_ happy and _VERY_ proud, because you understand the fundamental full-stack principles!

**If you don't understand something, get a mentor to help explain ASAP!**
